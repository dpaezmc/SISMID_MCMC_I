# This function draws numerical samples from the joint posterior 
# predictive distribution of frequencies n1, n11, n111 and n12.
# Each individual sample is based on one realisation from the posterior
# distribution of the escape probability q. The escape probability is
# common across all households.
#
# The function outputs the mean of the predictive distribution, based on the 
# sample. It also plots the samples from the predictive distribution of 
# frequencies n1 and n11.
